# twosingletDM
TRSM + Dark Matter + ElectroWeak Baryogenesis vs. Higgs Boson Pair production

# Instructions:

## Download MG5, e.g. 2.9.22 (https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo)
- Copy ```loop_sm_twoscalar_generic.tar.gz``` into MG5_aMC_2_9_22/models and untar it: ```tar xvzf loop_sm_twoscalar_generic.tar.gz```
- Launch MG5 and generate the process: 
```
./bin/mg5_aMC
import model loop_sm_twoscalar_generic
generate g g > h h [noborn=QCD]
output gg_hh_twoscalar
launch
```
- Enter and proceed to next screen, edit run card and change to the desired beam energies. -
- Exit and edit ```MG5_aMC_2_9_22/input/mg5_configuration.txt``, changing:
```
automatic_html_opening = False
```
- In the ```generate_mg5_trsm_xsecs.py``` script, change the following to the absolute directory of MG5:
```
MGLocation = '/home/apapaefs/Projects/TwoSingletDM/twosingletDM/MG5_aMC_v2_9_22/'
```
- Make sure ```ProcLocation['hh'] = 'gg_hh_twoscalar/'``` is set to the directory in which you have outputted the process.
- Get HiggsTools: https://gitlab.com/higgsbounds/higgstools.git and compile it:
in the HiggsTools directory:
```
mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make -j12
```
- You may need to ```make install```, otherwise make sure HiggsTools is in your PYTHONPATH
- You also need to place the HiggssBounds and HiggsSignals datasets in the twosingletDM directories: https://gitlab.com/higgsbounds/hbdataset and https://gitlab.com/higgsbounds/hsdataset.
- To begin the scan, execute ```generate_trsm_points.py SEED``` where the SEED is an integer to be used as a seed for the random numbers.
